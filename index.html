        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The task of classifying clinical disorders from speech and language patterns is a complex challenge that involves understanding the nuances of human communication and the various ways in which disorders can manifest.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="challenge-details">
        <h2>Challenge Details</h2>
        <p>Participants are required to develop a model that can accurately classify multiple clinical disorders from audio and transcript data. The challenge involves dealing with a wide range of variables, including different languages, dialects, and speech impairments.</p>
    </section>
   <section class="data">
    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>The dataset provided for this challenge is a comprehensive collection of audio recordings and transcripts from individuals with a range of clinical disorders. The data is categorized into five distinct classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parkinson's Data:</strong> Includes voice recordings from individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The data captures various speech impairments that are characteristic of the disorder, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia affecting speech.</li>
        <li><strong>Alzheimer's Dementia Data:</strong> Comprises cognitive speech data from individuals with Alzheimer's, highlighting the progressive nature of the disease and its impact on language and memory functions.</li>
        <li><strong>MCI Data:</strong> Consists of speech samples from individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment, a condition that may precede Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on early detection markers in speech patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Depression Data:</strong> Contains recordings from individuals diagnosed with depression, providing insights into speech features such as flat affect, speech rate, and tone that may correlate with depressive episodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Schizophrenia Data:</strong> Features speech and language data from individuals with schizophrenia, with an emphasis on detecting disorganized thinking and speech that may present as a symptom of the disorder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This rich dataset has been anonymized to protect the privacy of the individuals. It includes metadata such as age, gender, and the severity of the disorder, which can be used to stratify the data and potentially improve classification accuracy. Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset thoroughly to understand the complexities and nuances of each class of disorder.</p>

    <section class="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <p>Submissions will be evaluated based on their accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle noisy data. The use of innovative techniques and approaches to improve performance on minority classes will also be considered.</p>

    <h2>Study Coordinator</h2>
    <p>The multi-class classification study of clinical disorders using speech and language is coordinated by Birger Moëll, a dedicated PhD student specializing in speech and language pathology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. His research focuses on the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and medical diagnostics, aiming to advance the understanding and classification of speech-related symptoms in clinical disorders.</p>
