    <section class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The task of classifying clinical disorders from speech and language patterns is a complex challenge that
            involves understanding the nuances of human communication and the various ways in which disorders can
            manifest.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="challenge-details">
        <h2>Challenge Details</h2>
        <p>Participants are required to develop a model that can accurately classify multiple clinical disorders from
            audio and transcript data. The challenge involves dealing with a wide range of variables, including
            different languages, dialects, and speech impairments.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="data">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>The dataset provided for this challenge is a comprehensive collection of audio recordings and transcripts
            from individuals with a range of clinical disorders. The data is categorized into five distinct classes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parkinson's Data:</strong> Includes voice recordings from individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's
                disease. The data captures various speech impairments that are characteristic of the disorder, such as
                tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia affecting speech.</li>
            <li><strong>Alzheimer's Dementia Data:</strong> Comprises cognitive speech data from individuals with
                Alzheimer's, highlighting the progressive nature of the disease and its impact on language and memory
                functions.</li>
            <li><strong>MCI Data:</strong> Consists of speech samples from individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment, a
                condition that may precede Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on early detection markers in speech
                patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Depression Data:</strong> Contains recordings from individuals diagnosed with depression,
                providing insights into speech features such as flat affect, speech rate, and tone that may correlate
                with depressive episodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Schizophrenia Data:</strong> Features speech and language data from individuals with
                schizophrenia, with an emphasis on detecting disorganized thinking and speech that may present as a
                symptom of the disorder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This rich dataset has been anonymized to protect the privacy of the individuals. It includes metadata such as
            age, gender, and the severity of the disorder, which can be used to stratify the data and potentially
            improve classification accuracy. Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset thoroughly to understand
            the complexities and nuances of each class of disorder.</p>

        <section class="data-acess">
            <h2> Access to the data set</h2>
            In order to gain access to the Multi dataset, please email multi@kth.se with your contact information and
            affiliation, as well as a general statement on how you plan to use the data, with a specific mention of the
            multi challenge. If you are a student, please ask your supervisor to join as well. This membership will give
            you full access to the dataset through TalkBank, where the Multi dataset will be available.

        <section class="model-accuracy">
            <h2>Model Accuracy Calculation</h2>
            <p>The accuracy of classification models is a key metric in evaluating their performance. It is calculated
                as the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. The formula for accuracy is
                given by:</p>
            <p>\[ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \]</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>True Positives (TP):</strong> The number of correct predictions that an instance is
                    positive,</li>
                <li><strong>True Negatives (TN):</strong> The number of correct predictions that an instance is
                    negative,</li>
                <li><strong>False Positives (FP):</strong> The number of incorrect predictions that an instance is
                    positive, and</li>
                <li><strong>False Negatives (FN):</strong> The number of incorrect predictions that an instance is
                    negative.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Accuracy is often used as a measure in classification problems where the number of observations in each
                class is similar. It may not be a good indicator when dealing with imbalanced datasets.</p>

    <section class="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <p>Submissions will be evaluated based on their accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle noisy data. The use
            of innovative techniques and approaches to improve performance on minority classes will also be considered.

        <h2>Study Coordinator</h2>
        <p>The multi-class classification study of clinical disorders using speech and language is coordinated by Birger
            Moëll, a dedicated PhD student specializing in speech and language pathology at KTH Royal Institute of
            Technology. His research focuses on the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and medical
            diagnostics, aiming to advance the understanding and classification of speech-related symptoms in clinical
            disorders.</p>
